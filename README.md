# 🌸 Welcome to your Expo Habit App! 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).  
Let’s build something awesome together! ✨

## 🚀 Get Started

1. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the app**

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

   You’ll see options to open the app in:

   - 📱 [Development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
   - 🤖 [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
   - 🍏 [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
   - 🌐 [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) — try out your app instantly!

Start developing by editing files inside the **app** directory.  
This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction/) for easy navigation! 🗂️

## 🧹 Get a Fresh Project

Ready for a clean slate? Run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This will move the starter code to **app-example** and create a blank **app** directory for your new adventure! 🎨
